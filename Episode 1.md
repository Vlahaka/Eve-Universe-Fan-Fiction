“Engineer Rian J. Mecken...”

The compact, metallic quarters flickered to life as the station AI’s voice resonated through the walls calm, feminine, and unnervingly neutral.

“Report to your assigned post within sixty minutes,” it continued, the tone devoid of urgency, yet absolute in authority.

“Goddammit...” Rian muttered, dragging himself upright from the narrow bunk.
“Another six months on this tin can,” he sighed to himself.

The overhead lamps buzzed faintly, one stuttering with intermittent flashes, a minor fault no one would ever get around to fixing. He reached for his datapad from the shelf above the bed and scanned through the day’s maintenance docket.

“Of course,” he exhaled. “That damned Oracle again. Capacitor relays still fluctuating... must be the auxiliary field dampeners misaligned again.”
He rubbed his temples, feeling the low hum of the station through the metal floor.

“Five hundred ISK a week is still better than any on-planet site,” he told himself as he swung his legs off the bunk and pulled on his gold-brown work tunic.

The life-support scrubbers cycled louder, the recycler fans spooling up until their mechanical roar nearly drowned out his thoughts. He opened the tiny basin next to his bunk and splashed cold water against his face, the metal rim leaving a thin ring of condensation on his palm.

“If I don’t finish repairing that fossil today, I’ll tear it down myself and watch it fall apart,” the thought made him smile despite the exhaustion. He imagined the captain’s face, that smug, millionaire look, and the grin widened. “Would love to see his expression when the diagnostics finally go to hell.”

He snagged his datapad and jammed it into the breast pocket of his tunic, the screen still cycling through fault logs and capacitor readouts. Outside, the station thrummed, the steady, indifferent heartbeat of a place that ate time and paid in ISK. Rian braced himself for another shift under the Oracle’s shadow.

He walked nearly a hundred meters through narrow maintenance corridors before emerging from the quarters wing into one of the station’s main concourses, a cavernous hall alive with motion and noise.

The space was so vast the overhead lumin-panels couldn’t fully pierce the haze and pockets of shadow clung to the upper girders where the light faded.

*“...docks twenty-three, fifty-six, and ninety-one remain under renovation. Follow your assigned lead for further instructions,”*
the automated voice echoed from the public address system, calm but omnipresent.

Hundreds of workers and crew moved in every direction, some in pairs discussing diagnostics, others in uniform clusters carrying tools or datapads, and a few drifting alone between access walkways. Suspended levels and gantries crisscrossed the hall like arteries in a metallic organism.

This view always made Rian pause and look up for a second when he left the quarters wing, a reflex, a reminder of scale.

“Rian! Rian, over here!”

A youthful voice cut through the noise. Turning left, Rian spotted a slim figure waving a skinny arm. A young engineering trainee with close-cropped blond hair, standing beside a compact grav-cart loaded with equipment cases.

“They still haven’t taken you off my shoulders, I see,” Rian said with a grin as he climbed behind the control yoke of the grav-cart.

“You wish,” Kade shot back, his tone bright and unshaken. “You’re stuck with me, Rian and by the Emperor’s grace, it’ll stay that way until I earn my license.”

“Right, just my…”

“Did you hear what they said on the ACN earlier?” Kade interrupted, leaning forward.

“No, Kade, I didn’t,” Rian replied, steering the cart onto the main transit line. “My bunk’s half a kilometer from anything resembling civilization. I don't have time to listen to the Amarr Certified News so enlighten me!”

“They caught a Blood Raider spy on Amarr Prime,” Kade said, his voice practically crackling with energy. “In a high-profile research complex just outside Dam-Torsad.”

Rian raised a brow. “A spy? In Dam-Torsad itself?”

The cart glided smoothly along the designated pathway, passing beneath a monumental archway plated with gold, but dulled by centuries of dust. Intricate engravings along the span depicted scenes of divine conquest and martyrdom, half-faded but still proud relics of the Empire’s self-image. Beyond it, they exited the main concourse.

“By the Lord’s mercy,” Rian muttered. “If the Blood Raiders can reach the heart of the Empire, they can reach anywhere. But what in His name were they after?”

The cart entered a narrow service tunnel, where the light came only from the track itself, a dim line stretching into darkness. The air grew heavy, metallic, and still. There were no recyclers here, just the sound of magnetic repulsion humming under the cart’s frame.

Kade’s excitement dimmed into unease. “According to ACN, they were trying to steal data on a prototype dreadnought being developed somewhere in Domain.” He turned toward Rian, his tone lower now. “They said it’s equipped with a new kind of turret.”

The grav-cart glided beneath another colossal archway and emerged into a secondary concourse, a hall even more immense than the last.

This one had windows stretching from floor to ceiling, vast transparent panes that framed the golden nebulae of the Domain region beyond. The light poured in like liquid fire, bathing everything in an amber glow. The metallic floors shimmered faintly, and the gold trims of Amarr iconography along the walls seemed almost alive in the illumination.

Far ahead, Rian spotted the food court, a noisy collection of stalls and communal benches scattered beneath a lattice of hanging banners bearing the imperial sigil. He adjusted the cart’s vector toward it without hesitation.

<img width="1536" height="1024" alt="1000005580" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5eb98072-3dc1-4cf3-8676-e459c8880e55" />

“Well, they caught the bloody heretic,” Rian said, shaking his head. “Maybe he didn’t get what he came for. Either way, I’d rather not find myself face to face with one of those psychopaths.”

Kade leaned back, half-grinning. “But where do you think that dread might be?”

Rian shot him a sideways look. “What are you now, a spy too? You picked the wrong station for your espionage debut.”

Kade laughed, and the cart eased to a stop along the food court’s perimeter. The two men stepped off, blending into the slow tide of station workers in line for their morning ration. The hum of the hall and the faint scent of rehydrated protein filled the air. Another day, another cycle, beneath the Empire’s golden light.

Rian placed his datapad beneath the scanner.
“Rian J. Mecken — breakfast,” he said flatly.
The protein distributor beeped once, acknowledged the request, and released a portion of nutrient paste onto a dented tray. A faint hiss of steam rose from the nozzle, carrying that familiar metallic scent of recycled water and synthesized soy.

Around him, the food court buzzed with overlapping conversations, a chorus of voices bouncing off metal and glass. As he picked up a tray and grabbed a spoon from the communal bin, fragments of chatter began to cut through the noise.

“My brother works the palace gates in Dam-Torsad,” a voice said nearby, urgent and excited. “He texted me this morning, he said Radek was the one who provided the key intel that led to the Blood Raider’s capture.”

Rian slowed his step, turning his head to scan the crowd, but before he could locate the source, another voice joined in.

“The Capsuleer Radek? The Lord’s chosen one? Well, of course it was him". 

The murmur spread like static across the tables, reverence mixed with fear. Rian exhaled and resumed his pace, navigating through the crowd toward the table where Kade was already waiting.

He noticed two men walked parallel to him, their movements crisp, purposeful. He recognized them instantly by their attire: black and brown leather trimmed in gold, the Viziam insignia stitched boldly on their shoulders.

Viziam is the Amarr Empire’s crown jewel of technology and weapons research and rarely had business this far out in Domain. Seeing their traders here, of all places, felt off. Aliastra was a retail station indeed, but not one of importance.

Rian frowned slightly. “What in His light are Viziam traders doing here?” he muttered, half to himself, as he took a seat across from Kade.

“What?” Kade mumbled, head tilted toward his tray, mouth still half-full.

Rian grimaced slightly. “There are two Viziam traders here. Did you see them?”

Kade looked up, still chewing. “Eh… no. But did you hear? Radek’s the one who gave the intel on that spy!”
He pointed toward the next table, where a cluster of people had already gathered around someone’s datapad. “That guy’s brother said it.”

Rian followed his gesture just as a voice from that table spoke loudly:
“He’s texting me again, it says *Radek single-handedly wiped out a whole Raider strike fleet. Held the last frigate scrambled until the Navy jumped in from Ertoo, Aridia. After interrogation, they found the spy on Amarr Prime.*”

For a moment, the food court erupted, a wave of shouting, laughter, and applause swelling through the hall. Someone slammed a tray on a table in celebration; others raised their cups in salute.

Kade jumped to his feet and joined in, clapping wildly, his spoon clattering to the floor. Rian hesitated, watching the ripple of excitement spread around him. Then, despite himself, he found his hands moving. Slow, but deliberate he joins the applause of the Empire’s faithful.

By the time Rian rose to his feet, the wave of excitement had already begun to fade. Kade turned toward him, eyes still bright.

“Man, I’d give anything to be a capsuleer...” He glanced around, realizing his spoon had vanished. “I’d be a god.”

He spotted it on the floor and bent to pick it up, brushing it off with a grin.

“Be careful what you wish for,” Rian said, his tone heavy with disdain. “What’s there to want? To be trapped in those eggs they call capsules?” He narrowed his eyes at Kade.

“But...”

“They’re only immortal inside those pods,” Rian cut him off, his voice rising slightly as he gestured with his own spoon. “Once they’re out, they’re just like you and me.” He tossed the spoon into the tray with a metallic clatter. “What’s so glorious about spending eternity sealed in a tank, staring at the void?”

Kade frowned, clearly offended, and hurried to defend them. “But they do come out. Sometimes.” He inspected his spoon for stray germs, unwilling to look Rian in the eye.

Rian snorted. “Yeah... for the Emperor’s blessing ceremonies, or when their patrons demand it. Outside of that? Hardly anyone’s ever seen a capsuleer in the flesh.”

Kade stared down at his empty tray, the shine of the overhead light reflected in its surface. He set his spoon gently inside.

“But the never-ending ISK must be nice,” he murmured.

Rian smirked faintly. “Well, I can’t argue with that. But...” he reached into his pocket and pulled out his datapad “what good is money if you can’t even live properly?”

He turned the pad toward Kade. “Come on. We need to get moving. The Oracle is waiting.”

Kade sighed, the moment of reflection fading into duty. “Did the new dampeners arrive?” he asked, standing and picking up his tray. “Or are we realigning them again?”

Rian rose as well, balancing his own tray as they walked toward the disposal chute. “According to this,” he said, tapping the datapad, “they were delivered this morning. So we swap them out, and if the stars are kind, we finish today.”
