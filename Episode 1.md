“Engineer Rian J. Mecken...”

The compact, metallic quarters flickered to life as the station AI’s voice resonated through the walls calm, feminine, and unnervingly neutral.

“Report to your assigned post within sixty minutes,” it continued, the tone devoid of urgency, yet absolute in authority.

“Goddammit...” Rian muttered, dragging himself upright from the narrow bunk.
“Another six months on this tin can,” he sighed to himself.

The overhead lamps buzzed faintly, one stuttering with intermittent flashes, a minor fault no one would ever get around to fixing. He reached for his datapad from the shelf above the bed and scanned through the day’s maintenance docket.

“Of course,” he exhaled. “That damned Oracle again. Capacitor relays still fluctuating... must be the auxiliary field dampeners misaligned again.”
He rubbed his temples, feeling the low hum of the station through the metal floor.

“Five hundred ISK a week is still better than any on-planet site,” he told himself as he swung his legs off the bunk and pulled on his gold-brown work tunic.

<img width="1536" height="1024" alt="1000005579" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87c50fd0-6518-42ef-9cab-d8db9b886a3a" />

The life-support scrubbers cycled louder, the recycler fans spooling up until their mechanical roar nearly drowned out his thoughts. He opened the tiny basin next to his bunk and splashed cold water against his face, the metal rim leaving a thin ring of condensation on his palm.

“If I don’t finish repairing that fossil today, I’ll tear it down myself and watch it fall apart,” the thought made him smile despite the exhaustion. He imagined the captain’s face, that smug, millionaire look, and the grin widened. “Would love to see his expression when the diagnostics finally go to hell.”

He snagged his datapad and jammed it into the breast pocket of his tunic, the screen still cycling through fault logs and capacitor readouts. Outside, the station thrummed, the steady, indifferent heartbeat of a place that ate time and paid in ISK. Rian braced himself for another shift under the Oracle’s shadow.

He walked nearly a hundred meters through narrow maintenance corridors before emerging from the quarters wing into one of the station’s main concourses, a cavernous hall alive with motion and noise.

The space was so vast the overhead lumin-panels couldn’t fully pierce the haze and pockets of shadow clung to the upper girders where the light faded.

*“...docks twenty-three, fifty-six, and ninety-one remain under renovation. Follow your assigned lead for further instructions,”*
the automated voice echoed from the public address system, calm but omnipresent.

Hundreds of workers and crew moved in every direction, some in pairs discussing diagnostics, others in uniform clusters carrying tools or datapads, and a few drifting alone between access walkways. Suspended levels and gantries crisscrossed the hall like arteries in a metallic organism.

This view always made Rian pause and look up for a second when he left the quarters wing, a reflex, a reminder of scale.

“Rian! Rian, over here!”

A youthful voice cut through the noise. Turning left, Rian spotted a slim figure waving a skinny arm. A young engineering trainee with close-cropped blond hair, standing beside a compact grav-cart loaded with equipment cases.

“They still haven’t taken you off my shoulders, I see,” Rian said with a grin as he climbed behind the control yoke of the grav-cart.

“You wish,” Kade shot back, his tone bright and unshaken. “You’re stuck with me, Rian and by the Emperor’s grace, it’ll stay that way until I earn my license.”

“Right, just my…”

“Did you hear what they said on the ACN earlier?” Kade interrupted, leaning forward.

“No, Kade, I didn’t,” Rian replied, steering the cart onto the main transit line. “My bunk’s half a kilometer from anything resembling civilization. I don't have time to listen to the Amarr Certified News so enlighten me!”

“They caught a Blood Raider spy on Amarr Prime,” Kade said, his voice practically crackling with energy. “In a high-profile research complex just outside Dam-Torsad.”

Rian raised a brow. “A spy? In Dam-Torsad itself?”

The cart glided smoothly along the designated pathway, passing beneath a monumental archway plated with gold, but dulled by centuries of dust. Intricate engravings along the span depicted scenes of divine conquest and martyrdom, half-faded but still proud relics of the Empire’s self-image. Beyond it, they exited the main concourse.

“By the Lord’s mercy,” Rian muttered. “If the Blood Raiders can reach the heart of the Empire, they can reach anywhere. But what in His name were they after?”

The cart entered a narrow service tunnel, where the light came only from the track itself, a dim line stretching into darkness. The air grew heavy, metallic, and still. There were no recyclers here, just the sound of magnetic repulsion humming under the cart’s frame.

Kade’s excitement dimmed into unease. “According to ACN, they were trying to steal data on a prototype dreadnought being developed somewhere in Domain.” He turned toward Rian, his tone lower now. “They said it’s equipped with a new kind of turret.”

The grav-cart glided beneath another colossal archway and emerged into a secondary concourse, a hall even more immense than the last.

This one had windows stretching from floor to ceiling, vast transparent panes that framed the golden nebulae of the Domain region beyond. The light poured in like liquid fire, bathing everything in an amber glow. The metallic floors shimmered faintly, and the gold trims of Amarr iconography along the walls seemed almost alive in the illumination.

Far ahead, Rian spotted the food court, a noisy collection of stalls and communal benches scattered beneath a lattice of hanging banners bearing the imperial sigil. He adjusted the cart’s vector toward it without hesitation.

<img width="1536" height="1024" alt="1000005580" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5eb98072-3dc1-4cf3-8676-e459c8880e55" />

“Well, they caught the bloody heretic,” Rian said, shaking his head. “Maybe he didn’t get what he came for. Either way, I’d rather not find myself face to face with one of those psychopaths.”

Kade leaned back, half-grinning. “But where do you think that dread might be?”

Rian shot him a sideways look. “What are you now, a spy too? You picked the wrong station for your espionage debut.”

Kade laughed, and the cart eased to a stop along the food court’s perimeter. The two men stepped off, blending into the slow tide of station workers in line for their morning ration. The hum of the hall and the faint scent of rehydrated protein filled the air. Another day, another cycle, beneath the Empire’s golden light.

Rian placed his datapad beneath the scanner.
“Rian J. Mecken — breakfast,” he said flatly.
The protein distributor beeped once, acknowledged the request, and released a portion of nutrient paste onto a dented tray. A faint hiss of steam rose from the nozzle, carrying that familiar metallic scent of recycled water and synthesized soy.

Around him, the food court buzzed with overlapping conversations, a chorus of voices bouncing off metal and glass. As he picked up a tray and grabbed a spoon from the communal bin, fragments of chatter began to cut through the noise.

“My brother works the palace gates in Dam-Torsad,” a voice said nearby, urgent and excited. “He texted me this morning, he said Radek was the one who provided the key intel that led to the Blood Raider’s capture.”

Rian slowed his step, turning his head to scan the crowd, but before he could locate the source, another voice joined in.

“The Capsuleer Radek? The Lord’s chosen one? Well, of course it was him". 

The murmur spread like static across the tables, reverence mixed with fear. Rian exhaled and resumed his pace, navigating through the crowd toward the table where Kade was already waiting.

He noticed two men walked parallel to him, their movements crisp, purposeful. He recognized them instantly by their attire: black and brown leather trimmed in gold, the Viziam insignia stitched boldly on their shoulders.

Viziam is the Amarr Empire’s crown jewel of technology and weapons research and rarely had business this far out in Domain. Seeing their traders here, of all places, felt off. Aliastra was a retail station indeed, but not one of importance.

Officially, the station still bore Aliastra’s name, but the Gallente design had long been buried under layers of Amarr refit. Gold replaced glass, scripture replaced signage and commerce got dressed in devotion.

Rian frowned slightly. “What in His light are Viziam traders doing here?” he muttered, half to himself, as he took a seat across from Kade.

“What?” Kade mumbled, head tilted toward his tray, mouth still half-full.

Rian grimaced slightly. “There are two Viziam traders here. Did you see them?”

Kade looked up, still chewing. “Eh… no. But did you hear? Radek’s the one who gave the intel on that spy!”
He pointed toward the next table, where a cluster of people had already gathered around someone’s datapad. “That guy’s brother said it.”

Rian followed his gesture just as a voice from that table spoke loudly:
“He’s texting me again, it says *Radek single-handedly wiped out a whole Raider strike fleet. Held the last frigate scrambled until the Navy jumped in from Ertoo, Aridia. After interrogation, they found the spy on Amarr Prime.*”

For a moment, the food court erupted, a wave of shouting, laughter, and applause swelling through the hall. Someone slammed a tray on a table in celebration; others raised their cups in salute.

Kade jumped to his feet and joined in, clapping wildly, his spoon clattering to the floor. Rian hesitated, watching the ripple of excitement spread around him. Then, despite himself, he found his hands moving. Slow, but deliberate he joins the applause of the Empire’s faithful.

By the time Rian rose to his feet, the wave of excitement had already begun to fade. Kade turned toward him, eyes still bright.

“Man, I’d give anything to be a capsuleer...” He glanced around, realizing his spoon had vanished. “I’d be a god.”

He spotted it on the floor and bent to pick it up, brushing it off with a grin.

“Be careful what you wish for,” Rian said, his tone heavy with disdain. “What’s there to want? To be trapped in those eggs they call capsules?” He narrowed his eyes at Kade.

“But...”

“They’re only immortal inside those pods,” Rian cut him off, his voice rising slightly as he gestured with his own spoon. “Once they’re out, they’re just like you and me.” He tossed the spoon into the tray with a metallic clatter. “What’s so glorious about spending eternity sealed in a tank, staring at the void?”

Kade frowned, clearly offended, and hurried to defend them. “But they do come out. Sometimes.” He inspected his spoon for stray germs, unwilling to look Rian in the eye.

Rian snorted. “Yeah... for the Emperor’s blessing ceremonies, or when their patrons demand it. Outside of that? Hardly anyone’s ever seen a capsuleer in the flesh.”

Kade stared down at his empty tray, the shine of the overhead light reflected in its surface. He set his spoon gently inside.

“But the never-ending ISK must be nice,” he murmured.

Rian smirked faintly. “Well, I can’t argue with that. But...” he reached into his pocket and pulled out his datapad “what good is money if you can’t even live properly?”

He turned the pad toward Kade. “Come on. We need to get moving. The Oracle is waiting.”

Kade sighed, the moment of reflection fading into duty. “Did the new dampeners arrive?” he asked, standing and picking up his tray. “Or are we realigning them again?”

Rian rose as well, balancing his own tray as they walked toward the disposal chute. “According to this,” he said, tapping the datapad, “they were delivered this morning. So we swap them out, and if the stars are kind, we finish today.”

The grav-cart glided steadily along the guide track toward Hangar 133-B. Neither man spoke; only the soft hum of the engines and the distant thrum of the station filled the silence between them.
Occasionally, Rian and Kade exchanged brief glances carrying wordless acknowledgments, sometimes even a tired smile.

<img width="1536" height="1024" alt="1000005588" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6d29bde-46ea-46dc-8d78-a2f71f79578a" />

They passed through a succession of wide service corridors, each opening into colossal docks and auxiliary hangars. Shafts of golden light spilled through the high partitions, scattering against plumes of coolant mist and glinting on steel scaffolds.

And then, far ahead framed by the immense arch of the final bay stood the silhouette of the Oracle-class battlecruiser.

Vertical. Ancient. Dormant.

It hung motionless, clamped to the maintenance rig like a caged giant, its hull dark and unpowered. Thick magnetic anchors secured its frame to the docking lattice. Normally, ships floated gracefully in their berths, suspended by null-grav fields, but not this one, for its capacitor systems can’t sustain null-grav suspension.

As they approached the loading bay, the shadow of the colossal battlecruiser fell over them. Rian slowed the grav-cart, watching the morning shift already in motion. Workers were climbing scaffolds that wrapped the ship’s massive frame, others guided industrial arms that replaced sections of scorched tungsten armor with fresh plating. Hydraulic lifts hissed, and sparks flickered like fireflies against the hangar’s golden haze.

The Oracle loomed above them, motionless and bound, a slumbering giant surrounded by the noise of smaller lives.

The cart hadn’t even come to a full stop before Kade jumped off, landing lightly on the platform. “You know what’s weird?” he said, walking toward Rian, eyes fixed on the ship. “We’ve never seen the crew. Only the captain.”

Rian stepped down from the cart more deliberately, his calm unbroken. “I asked the same thing yesterday,” he said. “The captain told me he’d given them planetside leave.”

They walked together toward the scaffolds, boots echoing on the deck. Kade frowned. “Still... no guards, no maintenance crew. Since I’ve been stationed here, I’ve never seen a ship left completely unguarded.”

Rian opened his datapad as they walked, scrolling through the Oracle’s maintenance manifest and personnel logs. “What do I care,” he muttered. “I’m paid to fix things, not to ask useless questions.”

He raised an eyebrow, datapad shows two identical entries for the same crew member.
“Duplicate registration,” he murmured, quickly closing the screen. “I suggest you focus on your job, Kade.”

As they reached their workstation, the scene ahead caught their attention, a vast maintenance platform stretched between the hangar floor and the ship’s primary access port, framed on both sides by towering scaffolds.

In the center of the platform stood the Oracle’s captain. His uniform gleamed under the hangar lights, immaculate as always.

“He’s already here,” Kade said, surprised, pointing toward the figure.

Rian slapped his hand lightly away. “If he’s here this early, it probably means he’s bringing in another mod he wants installed.”

Kade groaned, letting his shoulders drop. “Of course... more work for us. Probably another one of those upgrades we’ll have to redo later anyway.”

Rian allowed himself a half-smile. “Welcome to the glamour of ship maintenance.”

“Check those new dampeners,” Rian ordered, making his way toward the captain. “I’ll go see what he wants today.”

“Aye aye, boss,” Kade replied, already prying open the shipment crate.

Hangar 133-B stretched vertically through several levels stacked above one another. High above the Oracle’s berth, the grav-field thrummed under the weight of a heavier ship. A low, resonant vibration that rolled through the hangar’s metal frame.
On the far side, directly opposite the scaffolds, yawned a massive transit tunnel, the artery through which ships entered and departed the hangar.

Rian glanced toward it as he walked. The tunnel always unsettled him, for it was vast, silent, and devoid of light. When no ship passed through, it became an abyss, swallowing every photon until it looked like a black hole cut through the station’s wall.

“The absence of light terrifies us, doesn’t it?” came a voice ahead.

Rian turned. The Oracle’s captain greeted, his gold-trimmed uniform catching the ambient glow.

“The Emperor’s grace guide you, my Lord Captain,” Rian said quickly. His posture straightened; hands pressed to his sides as he bowed deeply.

“And with you,” the captain answered, dismissing the salute with a faint motion of his hand. “The new dampeners arrived, yes? Will you have them installed by end of cycle?”

Rian glanced over his shoulder. Kade was still wrestling with the packaging crate. “We’re inspecting them as we speak, my Lord.”

The captain followed his gaze, noticing Kade’s struggle. A thin smile touched his lips. “Very well. I’ll be aboard the ship for most of the day. Have lunch with me, will you?”

Rian froze. His eyes widened slightly and the world seemed to fade around him for a second. “Of... of course, my Lord.”

“Carry on,” the captain said, already turning toward the Oracle’s airlock.

Rian stood motionless, his thoughts spiraling.
*A station worker, having lunch with a captain*, it was unthinkable. His mind raced as he watched the man walk away. Was it curiosity? Worry? Excitement? Or perhaps an opportunity, a chance to move beyond maintenance work and into something greater, something that paid perhaps more ISK?

He exhaled sharply, trying to steady himself, and turned toward Kade to help with the unpacking.

Then, a sudden bang.

A deep, muffled boom rolled through the hangar from somewhere distant, the kind that traveled through the floor before it reached the ears. Every worker froze. Tools hung suspended in mid-motion. The entire hangar, was vast, alive, thunderous just seconds before, suddenly fell completely silent,  some tools still buzzing.

Rian’s head snapped upward, eyes scanning the higher decks. Across the platform, the captain had also stopped, one foot placed on the platform to the ship’s hull.

For a heartbeat, nothing moved.

Then came another boom, sharper, closer, less muffled. The sound tore through the air, echoing up the scaffold towers and rattling the clamps that held the Oracle in place.

Before anyone could speak, an explosion erupted.
The shockwave rippled through the hangar, knocking workers off balance and sending a rain of dust and sparks from the upper levels. The lights flickered, dimmed, then burst back into life, tinted blood-red.

**Alarms erupted.**
“Hostile incursion detected in orbit!
Proceed to the evacuation pods! This is not a drill" 
The automated voice burst, repeating itself over the wail of klaxons.

Rian stumbled backward, catching himself on a railing. “What the hell was that?!” he shouted, though his words were drowned by the roar of venting pressure somewhere in the distance.

The massive tunnel at the far end of the hangar, that black void he’d always hated, was no longer dark. It pulsed with light and shadows flickered within it. The air grew heavy with the scent of burning metal and insulation.

Another explosion, this time came from the lower levels.
The entire hangar convulsed and brightened for a second. Metal screamed as the scaffolds around the Oracle tore loose and collapsed, raining sparks and debris. Workers fell from the higher platforms, their shouts swallowed by the roar of shattering steel.

Bulkhead doors slammed shut one after another with deafening force, sealing compartments in sequence. The sound of grinding servos and screaming voices filled the air, the panic spreads faster than the fire.

Rian staggered, forces his breath steady. He scanned the chaos.

Kade lay a few meters away, motionless at first. The shipment crate overturned beside him, its contents scattered across the deck. The dampeners still trembled, rolling from the residual vibration of the blast. The explosion must have thrown both Kade and the delivery clear across the bay.

Rian’s heart lurched. He sprinted toward him. “Kade! Kade!”

Before he could reach him, Kade stirred, one arm twitching, struggling to push himself upright amid the drifting haze and falling embers. Relief washed through Rian, but only for a moment. The air was still shaking with distant detonations.

“Come on, Kade! We need to reach the pods!” Rian shouted, crouching beside him.

Kade struggled to stand, coughing through the smoke. He lifted a trembling hand and pointed toward the Oracle.

Rian followed his gaze and then he froze.

Up on the platform near the ship’s entrance, the captain was pinned beneath a twisted section of collapsed scaffolding. Sparks rained around him, his gold-trimmed uniform now streaked with soot and blood.

“We... we...” Kade tried to speak, but another coughing fit cut him off.

“Come on,” Rian said, forcing his voice over the roaring alarms. “We have to help him!”

He pulled Kade up by the arm, steadying him as the deck trembled again under another distant impact. The sound of pressurized air and groaning metal filled the hangar as they began pushing through the chaos toward the fallen captain.

The hangar shook violently, every tremor throwing sparks and debris from above. Rian and Kade fought their balance, stumbling over twisted metal as they pushed forward, but they reached the captain.

“Pull him!” Rian shouted, straining to lift a section of steel that had pinned the man down.

“We’ll take you to the pods, Cap!” Kade yelled, gripping the captain’s arm and pulling with all his strength.

“No, there’s... no time!” the captain gasped between labored breaths. His uniform was torn, one leg crushed beneath the debris. “We’ll all be dead before we reach them...”
He winced in pain, eyes darting toward the massive ship towering them. “Take me to the Oracle. Cargo hold one... we can survive there.”

“The ship has no power, Captain! We can’t even pressurize it!” Rian shouted back, forcing the man’s arm over his shoulder while Kade did the same on the other side.

The captain’s voice dropped, harsh but certain. He locked eyes with Rian, his tone suddenly cold and absolute. “If you want to live...” another shower of sparks fell around them “do as I say.”
