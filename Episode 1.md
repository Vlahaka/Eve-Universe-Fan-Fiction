“Engineer Rian J. Mecken...”

The compact, metallic quarters flickered to life as the station AI’s voice resonated through the walls calm, feminine, and unnervingly neutral.

“Report to your assigned post within sixty minutes,” it continued, the tone devoid of urgency, yet absolute in authority.

“Goddammit...” Rian muttered, dragging himself upright from the narrow bunk.
“Another six months on this tin can,” he sighed to himself.

The overhead lamps buzzed faintly, one stuttering with intermittent flashes, a minor fault no one would ever get around to fixing. He reached for his datapad from the shelf above the bed and scanned through the day’s maintenance docket.

“Of course,” he exhaled. “That damned Oracle again. Capacitor relays still fluctuating... must be the auxiliary field dampeners misaligned again.”
He rubbed his temples, feeling the low hum of the station through the metal floor.

“Five hundred ISK a week is still better than any on-planet site,” he told himself as he swung his legs off the bunk and pulled on his gold-brown work tunic.

The life-support scrubbers cycled louder, the recycler fans spooling up until their mechanical roar nearly drowned out his thoughts. He opened the tiny basin in the corner of the quarter and splashed cold water against his face, the metal rim leaving a thin ring of condensation on his palm.

“If I don’t finish repairing that fossil today, I’ll tear it down myself and watch it fall apart,” the thought made him smile despite the exhaustion. He imagined the captain’s face, that smug, millionaire look, and the grin widened. “Would love to see his expression when the diagnostics finally go to hell.”

He snagged his datapad and jammed it into the breast pocket of his tunic, the screen still cycling through fault logs and capacitor readouts. Outside, the station thrummed, the steady, indifferent heartbeat of a place that ate time and paid in ISK. Rian braced himself for another shift under the Oracle’s shadow.

He walked nearly a hundred meters through narrow maintenance corridors before emerging from the quarters wing into one of the station’s main concourses, a cavernous hall alive with motion and noise.

The space was so vast the overhead lumin-panels couldn’t fully pierce the haze and pockets of shadow clung to the upper girders where the light faded.

*“...docks twenty-three, fifty-six, and ninety-one remain under renovation. Follow your assigned lead for further instructions,”*
the automated voice echoed from the public address system, calm but omnipresent.

Hundreds of workers and crew moved in every direction, some in pairs discussing diagnostics, others in uniform clusters carrying tools or datapads, and a few drifting alone between access walkways. Suspended levels and gantries crisscrossed the hall like arteries in a metallic organism.

This view always made Rian pause and look up for a second when he left the quarters wing, a reflex, a reminder of scale.

“Rian! Rian, over here!”

A youthful voice cut through the noise. Turning left, Rian spotted a slim figure waving a skinny arm. A young engineering trainee with close-cropped blond hair, standing beside a compact grav-cart loaded with equipment cases.

“They still haven’t taken you off my shoulders, I see,” Rian said with a grin as he climbed behind the control yoke of the grav-cart.

“You wish,” Kade shot back, his tone bright and unshaken. “You’re stuck with me, Rian and by the Emperor’s grace, it’ll stay that way until I earn my license.”

“Right, just my…”

“Did you hear what they said on the ACN earlier?” Kade interrupted, leaning forward.

“No, Kade, I didn’t,” Rian replied, steering the cart onto the main transit line. “My bunk’s half a kilometer from anything resembling civilization. I don't have time to listen to the Amarr Certified News so enlighten me!”

“They caught a Blood Raider spy on Amarr Prime,” Kade said, his voice practically crackling with energy. “In a high-profile research complex just outside Dam-Torsad.”

Rian raised a brow. “A spy? In Dam-Torsad itself?”

The cart glided smoothly along the designated pathway, passing beneath a monumental archway plated with gold, but dulled by centuries of dust. Intricate engravings along the span depicted scenes of divine conquest and martyrdom, half-faded but still proud relics of the Empire’s self-image. Beyond it, they exited the main concourse.

“By the Lord’s mercy,” Rian muttered. “If the Blood Raiders can reach the heart of the Empire, they can reach anywhere. But what in His name were they after?”

The cart entered a narrow service tunnel, where the light came only from the track itself, a dim line stretching into darkness. The air grew heavy, metallic, and still. There were no recyclers here, just the sound of magnetic repulsion humming under the cart’s frame.

Kade’s excitement dimmed into unease. “According to ACN, they were trying to steal data on a prototype dreadnought being developed somewhere in Domain.” He turned toward Rian, his tone lower now. “They said it’s equipped with a new kind of turret.”

The grav-cart glided beneath another colossal archway and emerged into a secondary concourse, a hall even more immense than the last.

This one had windows stretching from floor to ceiling, vast transparent panes that framed the golden nebulae of the Domain region beyond. The light poured in like liquid fire, bathing everything in an amber glow. The metallic floors shimmered faintly, and the gold trims of Amarr iconography along the walls seemed almost alive in the illumination.

Far ahead, Rian spotted the food court, a noisy collection of stalls and communal benches scattered beneath a lattice of hanging banners bearing the imperial sigil. He adjusted the cart’s vector toward it without hesitation.

“Well, they caught the bloody heretic,” Rian said, shaking his head. “Maybe he didn’t get what he came for. Either way, I’d rather not find myself face to face with one of those psychopaths.”

Kade leaned back, half-grinning. “But where do you think that dread might be?”

Rian shot him a sideways look. “What are you now, a spy too? You picked the wrong station for your espionage debut.”

Kade laughed, and the cart eased to a stop along the food court’s perimeter. The two men stepped off, blending into the slow tide of station workers in line for their morning ration. The hum of the hall and the faint scent of rehydrated protein filled the air. Another day, another cycle, beneath the Empire’s golden light.
